## Description
The package epos contains two programs, `epos` itself and
`epos2ages`. `Epos` estimates historic population sizes from site
frequency data, and `epos2ages` converts these estimates to allele
ages. The data file `FoldSFS_YRI.txt` is taken from Lapierre, Lambert,
and Achaz (2017, Genetics, 206:439).
## Compilation
The sources are compiled using
`make`
The executables `epos` and `epos2ages` are now located in the
directory `build`.
## Documentation
The command
`make doc`
generates the manual `doc/epos.pdf`.
